<h1>Raspberry Pi Classroom setup</h1>

<p>So you've got a class set of Raspberry Pis. It's time to unbox them and get your students exploring Linux and Physical Computing. You have several options for using Raspberry Pis in a classroom, all detailed below.</p>

<h2>Option 1 - Use existing infrastructure</h2>

<p>Raspberry Pis work well in existing IT suites, where keyboards, mice and monitors are already situated. As well as the class-set of Raspberry Pis you'll need:
1. A matching number of power supplies <em>or</em> USB A to micro-B cables
2. A matching number of SD cards</p>

<p>You can power a Raspberry Pi using either a micro USB power supply, or using the USB port of a computer. The computer will need to be on, if you're choosing to power it this way.</p>

<p>Remove the HDMI cable and USB mouse and keyboard from the PC and plug them into the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<h2>Option 2 - Use a KVM switch</h2>

<p>A <strong>K</strong>eyboard <strong>V</strong>ideo <strong>M</strong>onitor switch allows you to control two different computers using the same peripherals.
You can purchase <a href="http://www.ebuyer.com/store/Networking/cat/KVM-Switches">KVM switches</a> relatively cheeply if you shop around.</p>

<p>With a KVM switch, changing between using the Raspberry Pi and the PC can be accomplished with the push of a button. Simply connect the keyboard, mouse and montior to the KVM switch, and then connect both the Raspberry Pi and PC to the KVM switch.</p>

<h2>Option 3 - Remote with VNC</h2>

<p>So long as your Raspberry Pis are networked (either via WiFi or a Network Switch), you operate them remotely from you existing networked computer.
<strong>V</strong>irtual <strong>N</strong>etwork <strong>C</strong>omputing is a protocol that allows you to control one computer from another computer. The advantage of using VNC is that you gain access to the full desktop of the Raspberry Pi, meaning you can use graphical programs from the connected computer.</p>

<ul>
<li>First you will need to install a VNC server onto the Raspberry Pi. Open up the terminal and type:</li>
</ul>

<p><code>bash
sudo apt-get install tightvncserver
</code></p>

<ul>
<li>With the sever installed you need to start it running</li>
</ul>

<p><code>bash
tightvncserver
</code></p>

<ul>
<li><p>You'll need to create a password at this point.</p></li>
<li><p>Now you can use another computer to control the Raspberry Pi.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>On Windows</h3>

<ul>
<li>You can download a vnc viewer from <a href="http://www.tightvnc.com/download.php">here</a></li>
<li>Once installed you can easily connect to a Raspberry Pi
