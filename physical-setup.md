# Physical Classroom setup

So you've got a class set of Raspberry Pis. It's time to unbox them and get your students exploring Linux and Physical Computing. You have several options for using Raspberry Pis in a classroom, all detailed below.

## Option 1 - Use existing infrastructure

Raspberry Pis work well in existing IT suites, where keyboards, mice and monitors are already situated. As well as the class-set of Raspberry Pis you'll need:
1. A matching number of power supplies *or* USB A to micro-B cables
2. A matching number of SD cards

You can power a Raspberry Pi using either a micro USB power supply, or using the USB port of a computer. The computer will need to be on, if you're choosing to power it this way.

Remove the HDMI cable and USB mouse and keyboard from the PC and plug them into the Raspberry Pi.

## Option 2 - Use a KVM switch

A **K**eyboard **V**ideo **M**onitor switch allows you to control two different computers using the same peripherals.
You can purchase [KVM switches](http://www.ebuyer.com/store/Networking/cat/KVM-Switches) relatively cheeply if you shop around.

With a KVM switch, changing between using the Raspberry Pi and the PC can be accomplished with the push of a button. Simply connect the keyboard, mouse and montior to the KVM switch, and then connect both the Raspberry Pi and PC to the KVM switch.
